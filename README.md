## features

- controller simulation (C++)
- 3D visualization (C++, OpenGL)
- 2D graph plotting for control variables (python)

## directories

### c

c++ implementation of controller, simulator, and visualization (includes python script for basic graphing and opengl-based visualization program)

### doc
literature on quadrotors by myself and others

### python
python implementation of controller and simulator (out of date, focus is on c-implementation)





# c

c++ implementation

## directories

### quadrotor

core library for controller and simulator

### sim1

Contains the main program for setting up and running simulations.
Also contains the python graphing program and the opengl-based visulaization program.

### vis1

Should be removed. Abandoned glfw-based visualization
